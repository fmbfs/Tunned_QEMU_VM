%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Enable %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
1- Check the current huge page size: 
	grep -i huge /proc/meminfo
	
2- Add this arguments to QEMU launcher:
	-mem-path /dev/hugepages
	-mem-prealloc

3- Set the number of huge pages. Note that ti depends on the RAM allocated
and the huge page size itself: (10240 is for 2MB 20GB + 20 for small buffer)
	sudo sysctl -w vm.nr_hugepages=10260

4- Disable Transparent huge pages:
	echo "never" > "/sys/kernel/mm/transparent_hugepage/enabled"
	echo "never" > "/sys/kernel/mm/transparent_hugepage/defrag"

note:
What is transparent huge pages? 
Is the case where the application doesn't have knowledge of what a HugePage is, but the OS does, so it will transparently allocate HP to where it seems fit. Mind that it needs to be a continuos block of memory.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Back to default %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

5- remove this arguments to QEMU launcher:
	-mem-path /dev/hugepages
	-mem-prealloc

6- Set the number of huge pages to 0:
	sysctl -w vm.nr_hugepages=0

7- Enable Transparent huge pages:
	echo always > /sys/kernel/mm/transparent_hugepage/enabled
	echo always > /sys/kernel/mm/transparent_hugepage/defrag
